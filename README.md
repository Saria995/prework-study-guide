## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used as a reference source as it contains important beginners information on four main topics that all developers require, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 
The webpage is split into four sections and each of those sections has a heading for the listed topics. Under each heading there will be the information collected as bullet points to easily navigate. The JavaScript applied as part of this webpage can be seen running if we open the DevTools console. The JavaScript will list the topics learned as part of the prework (which is also the list of topics on the page) and will choose a topic at random to study first.
