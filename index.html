        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the stucture of the webpage. It is made up of elements which work togetherr to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements are used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers. Some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page include; Meta-related elements, Content division elements and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>Inside the head element we can use the following meta data tags:</li>
          <li>title: this element defines the title of a webpage</li>
          <li>style: this element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>base: element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>link: element contains an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element</li>
          <li>Some types of element tags include:</li>
          <li>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6: these represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>P element: represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>ul, ol and li: elements that represent unordered lists, ordered lists and list items.</li>
          <li>img: element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>br: element creates a line of empty space, or line break between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>a element: which stands for anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li></li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet and External CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Use inline CSS when you want to apply a change directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>The Internal Style SHeet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>When using an External CSS Style Sheet, we link an external file which has all our CSS styles using the link element placed in the HTMLs head. In this case you will need to make sure to link the CSS file to the HTML file otherwise changes won't be applied.</li>
          <li>Errors are referred to as bugs and finding those errors and fixing them is called debugging</li>
          <li>There are 5 main steps to use when debugging:</li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>The developer should compare what the outcome is doing in comparison to what it should be doing</li>
            <li>The developer should hunt for the bug in the code to find the problem/what is causing the problem</li>
            <li>After the error/bug has been found, the developer will have to find a solution to fix the bug</li>
            <li>When the developer has implemented a fix, they will need to test the app to make sure it is working properly and they haven't created new bugs somewhere else in the project</li>
            <li>Now that the bug is completely fixed, it's good practise to document the process you used to find the solution. This documentation can be used in future if same issue appears again</li>
          </ol>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>A box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame</li>
          <li>Assigning colours in CSS can be done in many ways, including semantic references such as blur or grey. We can also refer to code by its hexadecimal code</li>
