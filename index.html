        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the stucture of the webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements are used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers. Some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page include; Meta-related elements, Content division elements and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>Inside the head element we can use the following meta data tags:</li>
          <li>title: this element defines the title of a webpage</li>
          <li>style: this element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>base: element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>link: element contains an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element</li>
          <li>Some types of element tags include:</li>
          <li>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6: these represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>P element: represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>ul, ol and li: elements that represent unordered lists, ordered lists and list items.</li>
          <li>img: element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>br: element creates a line of empty space, or line break between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>a element: which stands for anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li></li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet and External CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Use inline CSS when you want to apply a change directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>The Internal Style SHeet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>When using an External CSS Style Sheet, we link an external file which has all our CSS styles using the link element placed in the HTMLs head. In this case you will need to make sure to link the CSS file to the HTML file otherwise changes won't be applied.</li>
          <li>Errors are referred to as bugs and finding those errors and fixing them is called debugging</li>
          <li>There are 5 main steps to use when debugging:</li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>The developer should compare what the outcome is doing in comparison to what it should be doing</li>
            <li>The developer should hunt for the bug in the code to find the problem/what is causing the problem</li>
            <li>After the error/bug has been found, the developer will have to find a solution to fix the bug</li>
            <li>When the developer has implemented a fix, they will need to test the app to make sure it is working properly and they haven't created new bugs somewhere else in the project</li>
            <li>Now that the bug is completely fixed, it's good practise to document the process you used to find the solution. This documentation can be used in future if same issue appears again</li>
          </ol>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>A box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame</li>
          <li>Assigning colours in CSS can be done in many ways, including semantic references such as blur or grey. We can also refer to code by its hexadecimal code</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch you are currently working on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>  
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. To declare a variable, we use the 'var' keyword after we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The broswer usually ignores text marked as comments.</li>
          <li>An Operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditional is the 'if'... 'else'</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that wou wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
          <li>Events- real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Control flows can be interrupted, we can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which the code is executed.</li>
          <li>JS is a dynamic language with dyanmic types. Variables in JS are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned values of all types.</li>
          <li>JS is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type of conversation when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
          <li>Primitive Values: All types, except 'object', define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. All primitive types, except null can be tested by the 'typeof' operator.</li>
          <li>Null type: is inhabited by exactly one value- 'null'</li>
          <li>Undefined type: is inhabited by one value- 'Undefined'. It indicates the absence of value, which null indicates the absence of an ovject.</li>
          <li>Boolean type: represents a logical entity and is inhabited by 2 values- true and false. They are used for conditional operations.</li>
          <li>String type: represents textual data and is enclosed as a sequence of 16-but unsigned integer values, representing UTF-16 code units. Each element in the string occupies a position in the string. The first element is at index 0, the next index 1 and so on.</li>
          <li>Symbol type: a symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an objext property. the purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other codes.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Array index: to work with individual data items inside an arraym we need to have the location of the data item in the array, this location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>The 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Array length: the loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by ising a built-in property of an array called Length.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following important statements:</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for the loop. When starting at the beginning, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length build-in property to express this condition.</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each time. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x+++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
